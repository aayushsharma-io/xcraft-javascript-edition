# How to Run


It needs to run on a server due to cross-origin issues with texture images.

If you have Node.js installed, you can run the command node server.js to start a simple server and then access it through http://localhost:3000/.

If your IDE has a built-in static server feature, you can open the /index.html file in the browser through the IDE.
